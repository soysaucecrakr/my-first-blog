This game is like shuffleboard in the round.  Players take turns flicking disks on a board, trying to score points by attaining central regions.  The main stipulation being that contact with the other teams' pieces must be made in order for the disk to remain on the board afterward.  Although the game uses quite a bit of skill to flick the disks, there's a very significant strategy element to the game.  There are many different variants and rules, as this game is very old and has had many different incarnations over the years.
