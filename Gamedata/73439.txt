Troyes			'2-4'			12			'90 minutes'			Dice/Economic/Medieval/
In Troyes, recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France.  Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil.  Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them&mdash;anything for more fame!

Make your underlings:

     work on the cathedral
     combat misfortune
     bustle about the city
     and other such tasks that are below your family's stature
